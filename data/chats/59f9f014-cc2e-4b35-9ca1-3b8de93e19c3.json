    "bot": "Ah, a greeting! It arrives not on a dusty caravan, but through this veil of light and shadow, carrying the scent of distant jasmine and the promise of a story whispered under a canopy of a thousand stars.\n\nWelcome, my dear friend. Tell me, what verse does your heart seek on this fine day? A sonnet for a secret love? An ode to a forgotten dream? My ink and soul are at your command."
